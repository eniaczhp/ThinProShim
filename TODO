- Versioned protocol:
  - Make shim and the bootloaders using it express how enlightened they
    are to one another, so we can stop earlier without tricks like the one
    above
  - Make a LoadImage/CheckImage/StartImage based protocol
- Hashing of option roms:
  - hash option roms and add them to MokListRT
  - probably belongs in MokManager
- Ability to specify second stage as a device path
  - including vendor path that means "parent of this image's path"
  - including vendor path that means "this image"
  - including path that's like Fv() to embed images.
