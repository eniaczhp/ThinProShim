# What organization or people are asking to have this signed:

    HP Inc.

# What product or service is this for:

    ThinPro for PC (an Ubuntu based Linux variant).  This is not our first linux release.  The actual version is 7.1.

# What's the justification that this really does need to be signed for the whole world to be able to boot it:

    Previous ThinPro are only released with HP hardwares support.  The next ThinPro release is targeted for not just HP's machines, but also general PC from other vendors.  We need our bootloader to be signed by MS UEFI key for it to be bootable there.

# What patches are being applied and why:

    abort_abort_abort.patch: define abort to avoid an unnecessary reloc.

# What OS and toolchain must we use to reproduce this build? Include where to find it, etc. We're going to try to reproduce your build as close as possible to verify that it's really a build of the source tree you tell us it is, so these need to be fairly thorough. At the very least include the specific versions of gcc, binutils, and gnu-efi which were used, and where to find those binaries.
